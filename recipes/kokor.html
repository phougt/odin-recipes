    <h3>Somlor Kokor</h3>
    <h4>Desciption</h4>
    <p>
      While amok is sometimes called the country’s national dish, and might be
      the one most familiar to tourists, samlor korkor has a better claim to
      being the true national dish of Cambodia. It has been eaten for hundreds
      of years and today can be found in restaurants, roadside stands and family
      homes alike. The ingredients list for this nourishing soup is versatile
      and easily adapted to whatever is seasonal and abundant; it often includes
      more than a dozen vegetables. It can be made with almost any type of meat,
      but most commonly it’s a hearty soup made from catfish and pork belly. The
      soup always includes two quintessential Cambodian ingredients – prahok, a
      type of fermented fish, and kroeung, a fragrant curry paste – and is then
      thickened with toasted ground rice.
