    <h3>Nombanhjok</h3>
    <h4>Desciption</h4>
    <p>
      Nom banh chok is a beloved Cambodian dish, so much so that in English it’s
      sometimes called simply “Khmer noodles.” It’s a typical breakfast food,
      and every morning you’ll find it being sold by women carrying baskets of
      fresh rice noodles hanging from a pole balanced on their shoulders. The
      dish consists of fresh noodles laboriously pounded out of rice, topped
      with a fish-based green curry gravy made from lemongrass, fingerroot
      ginger, turmeric, and garlic. Fresh cucumbers, banana flower, long beans,
      edible flowers, and wild leaves are heaped on top. In Siem Reap, it is
      served with a sweet sauce called tuk paem made from palm sugar and
      peanuts.
